## **1. Setting a Realistic Timeline**

Building a sales funnel isn't an overnight task. While the process may seem overwhelming, proper planning will help you stay on track.

### Time Commitment:
- **1–2 hours daily:** Recommended if you're balancing other responsibilities.
- **1–4 weeks full-time:** Ideal if you're financially secure and can dedicate concentrated time.

⏳ **Important Note**: If anyone promises you a fully functioning funnel that generates €10,000 in just a few days—they're likely lying. Success takes time, effort, and iteration.

## **2. Crafting Your Sales Page**

Your **sales page** is the most critical element of your funnel. A well-crafted page not only boosts conversions but also serves as the foundation for other marketing assets, such as social media posts and emails.

### **The AIDA Framework for Sales Pages**:

1. **Attention:** Create a captivating headline to grab attention.
2. **Interest:** Spark curiosity by connecting emotionally with your audience.
3. **Desire:** Build trust and show how your solution solves their problem.
4. **Action:** Include a clear call-to-action (CTA) for purchase.

### **Estimated Time to Create a Sales Page:**
- 3–5 hours.

### **Pro Tip**: A polished sales page converts around 2–3%. For tips on optimizing your sales page, check out [this free guide](https://bit.ly/LEadPages).

## **3. Lead Magnets and Welcome Automations**

Lead magnets (or opt-in offers) are essential for capturing your audience's contact information. 

### **Creating a High-Converting Lead Magnet:**
- Solve a specific pain point (e.g., a checklist, guide, or short video).
- Test different formats (PDF, video, or workbook).
- Promote your lead magnet across multiple channels (e.g., social media, blogs, and emails).

### **Email Automation Tips:**
- **Welcome Sequence:** Start with a 3-email series:
  1. Deliver the lead magnet.
  2. Address common FAQs.
  3. Introduce yourself and your expertise.

### **Time Estimates:**
- Lead magnet creation: 1–3 hours.
- Email sequence setup: 8–10 hours.

### Estimated Time:
